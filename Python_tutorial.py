                                 # Operators:
#Arithmetic operators: Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
# Examples of Arithmetic Operator 
a = 9
b = 4
   
# Addition of numbers 
add = a + b 
# Subtraction of numbers  
sub = a - b 
   
# print results 
print(add) 
print(sub) 

#Relational Operators: Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition:
# Examples of Relational Operators 
a = 13
b = 33
   
# a > b is False 
print(a > b) 
   
# a < b is True 
print(a < b) 
   
# a == b is False 
print(a == b) 
   
# a != b is True 
print(a != b) 
   
# a >= b is False 
print(a >= b) 
   
# a <= b is True 
print(a <= b)

#Logical Operators: Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical NOT operations.
# Examples of Logical Operator 
a = True
b = False
   
# Print a and b is False 
print(a and b) 
   
# Print a or b is True 
print(a or b) 
   
# Print not a is False 
print(not a) 

#Bitwise operators: Bitwise operator acts on bits and performs bit by bit operation.
# Examples of Bitwise operators 
a = 10
b = 4
   
# Print bitwise AND operation   
print(a & b) 
   
# Print bitwise OR operation 
print(a | b) 
   
# Print bitwise NOT operation  
print(~a) 
   
# print bitwise XOR operation  
print(a ^ b) 
   
# print bitwise right shift operation  
print(a >> 2) 
   
# print bitwise left shift operation  
print(a << 2)

#Assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables.
#Special operators: Special operators are of two types-

#Identity operator that contains is and is not.
#Membership operator that contains in and not in.

# Examples of Identity and 
# Membership operator
  
a1 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
b1 = 'GeeksforGeeks'
 
# Identity operator
print(a1 is not b1)
print(a1 is b1)
 
# Membership operator
print("G" in a1)
print("N" not in b1)

Strings:
hello= 'hello'
print(type(hello)) => <class 'str'>

Creating Strings
# Single quotes
string1 = 'Hello, world!'

# Double quotes
string2 = "Python is fun!"

# Triple quotes for multiline strings
string3 = """This is a
multiline string."""

Basic String Operations
# Concatenation
combined = string1 + " " + string2

# Repetition
repeated = string1 * 3

# Length
length = len(string1)

# Accessing characters
first_char = string1[0]
last_char = string1[-1]

# Slicing
substring = string1[0:5]
String Methods

# Changing case
upper_case = string1.upper()
lower_case = string1.lower()

# Splitting and joining
words = string2.split()  # Splits into a list of words
joined = " ".join(words)  # Joins list into a string

# Stripping whitespace
trimmed = "  Hello  ".strip()

# Replace
replaced = string1.replace("world", "Python")

# Finding substrings
index = string1.find("world")  # Returns -1 if not found

# Checking content
is_alpha = "abc".isalpha()
is_digit = "123".isdigit()
String Formatting

# f-strings (Python 3.6+)
name = "Alice"
formatted = f"Hello, {name}!"

# format() method
formatted = "Hello, {}!".format(name)

# Old-style formatting
formatted = "Hello, %s!" % name
Escape Characters

# Newline and tab
new_line = "Hello\nWorld"
tabbed = "Hello\tWorld"

# Escape quotes
quote = "She said, \"Python is awesome!\""


Strings are immutable in Python, so methods that modify a string return a new string.
Use r"raw strings" to avoid escaping backslashes in paths or regex patterns.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								#Python Data Types
# Numeric(Integer, Float) --> In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be interger, 
# floating number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex.
print("Type of a: ", type(5)) 
print("\nType of b: ", type(5.0)) 
# Dictionary->
# Boolean 
# Set
# Sequence Type ----> Strings, List, Tuples

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#List: mutable, ordered and that's why slicing possible
#Tuple: Immutable, ordered and that's why slicing possible 
#set: mutable, unordered and slicing not possible.

'''
Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists. When it comes to the time efficiency, again tuples have a slight advantage over the lists especially when lookup to a value is considered

# Decision Making
# Decision Making in programming is similar to decision making in real life. A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of the program based on certain conditions. These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.

# Decision-making statements in Python
#    if statement
#    if..else statements
#    nested if statements
#    if-elif ladder

#Example 1: To demonstrate if and if-else
# Python program to demonstrate
# decision making
 
a = 10
b = 15
 
# if to check even number
if a % 2 == 0:
    print("Even Number")
     
# if-else to check even or odd
if b % 2 == 0:
    print("Even Number")
else:
    print("Odd Number")
'''
Output:

Even Number
Odd Number
'''

# Example 2: To demonstrate nested-if and if-elif
# Python program to demonstrate
# decision making
 
a = 10
 
# Nested if to check whether a 
# number is divisible by both 2 and 5
if a % 2 == 0:
    if a % 5 == 0:
        print("Number is divisible by both 2 and 5")
         
# is-elif
if (a == 11): 
    print ("a is 11") 
elif (a == 10): 
    print ("a is 10")
else: 
    print ("a is not present")

Output:

Number is divisible by both 2 and 5
a is 10

# Control flow (Loops)
# Loops in programming come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. For example: Suppose we want to print 'Hello World' 10 times. 
# This can be done with the help of loops. The loops in Python are:

# Python program to illustrate  
# while and while-else loop
i = 0
while (i < 3):      
    i = i + 1
    print("Hello Geek")  
   
# checks if list still 
# contains any element  
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
while a: 
    print(a.pop()) 
   
i = 10
while i < 12:  
    i += 1
    print(i)  
    break
else: # Not executed as there is a break  
    print("No Break")

# Loop control statements
# Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. Following are the loop control statements provided by Python:
# Break: Break statement in Python is used to bring the control out of the loop when some external condition is triggered.
# Continue: Continue statement is opposite to that of break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop.
# Pass: Pass statement is used to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.

# Python program to demonstrate break, continue and pass

# Functions
# Functions are generally the block of codes or statements in a program that gives the user the ability to reuse the same code which ultimately saves the excessive use of memory, acts as a time saver and more importantly, provides better readability of the code. So basically, a function is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A function can also perform some specific task without returning anything. In Python, def keyword is used to create functions.
# Python program to demonstrate
# functions
 
 
# Defining functions

# Function that returns sum
# of first 10 numbers

# Object Oriented Programming
# Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. 
# The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function

# Classes and Objects
# Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.
# An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
# Python program to demonstrate classes and objects
   
class Dog:  
       
    # A simple class attribute
    attr1 = "mamal"
    attr2 = "dog"
   
    # A sample method   
    def fun(self):  
        print("I'm a", self.attr1)

# Driver code 
# Object instantiation 
Rodger = Dog() 
   
# Accessing class attributes 
# and method through objects

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The self
# self represents the instance of the class. By using the self keyword 
# we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.
# Note: For more information, refer self in Python class.
# Constructors and Destructor

# Constructors: Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.
# The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of 
# the class when an object of class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created. There can be two types of constructors:
# Default constructor: The constructor which is called implicilty and do not accept any argument.
# Parameterized constructor:Constructor which is called explicitly with parameters is known as parameterized constructor.

# Python program to demonstrate constructors
 
 
class Addition:
    # parameterized constructor 
    def __init__(self, f, s): 
        self.first = f 
        self.second = s
   
    def calculate(self):
        print(self.first + self.second)
   
# Invoking parameterized constructor
obj = Addition(1000, 2000) 
   
# perform Addition 
obj.calculate()

Output:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Destructors: Destructors are called when an object gets destroyed. The __del__() method is a known as a destructor method in Python. It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected.
# Python program to illustrate destructor 
class Employee: 
   
    # Initializing 
    def __init__(self): 
        print('Employee created.') 
   
    # Deleting (Calling destructor) 
    def __del__(self):

# Inheritance
# Inheritance is the ability of any class to extract and use features of other classes. It is the process by which new classes called the derived classes are created from existing classes called Base classes.
